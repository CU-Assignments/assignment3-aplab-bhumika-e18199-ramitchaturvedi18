Print Link list
### Print Linked List

## Aim:
To develop a program that traverses a given singly linked list and prints all its elements in a single line, separated by spaces.

## Objectives:
1. Understand the structure of a singly linked list.
2. Implement a function to iterate through the list.
3. Print each nodeâ€™s value in the correct format.
4. Ensure the program works efficiently within the given constraints.

## Code :
class Solution {
  public:
    void printList(Node *head) {
        Node*temp=head;
        while(temp!=nullptr){
            cout<<temp->data<<" ";
            temp=temp->next;
        }
    }
};
